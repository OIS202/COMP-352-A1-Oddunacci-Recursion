For the linear version the time elasped is so short that its negligible and the computer records it as 0 time elapsed which is of course not precise but the computer will 
have to measure it nanoseconds or maybe even a smaller fraction to be able to compute the actual time elapsed. 

For the binary version the time elapsed I have used is up to the 40th term in the sequence as I tried to go for higher than that but the program took so long to execute
that I thought it might crash my pc or even worse.

In general, for both algorithms if we calculate up to the big terms like the 90th term using a long will not suffice so it is evident that when we get to the big terms the size
of the long type is not big enough so there are overflow errors which result in negative numbers in the last iterations of the algorithms.
